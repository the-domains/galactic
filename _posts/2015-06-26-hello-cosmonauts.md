I'm Reema, and in the time it took me to make this site, I could have flown around the world to say hello to all of you in person. Twice. But you're already aware of the [headache involved in customizing a template][0], since The Grid is quickly becoming one of the most well-funded software crowd-funding campaigns in recent history. Your list of founding members (of which I am one) is growing day after day because your team built a solution that we didn't even know we could ask for. "What if websites built themselves?" Such a simple question, but one that is going to impact the evolution of technology and design for years to come. 

The Grid is the future, and I want to be part of it.
